# Input Files
The basic input file for MachUp contains a JSON object which describes the scene and which aircraft are in the scene, along with the state of those aircraft in the scene. A separate JSON object is used to specify the geometry and controls of each aircraft. These aircraft objects can reference other files that store information on airfoil properties, chord distributions, sweep, etc., as will be discussed. At a minimum, two JSON objects will be created by the user, a scene object and an aircraft object.

## JSON Format
The basic structure of a JSON object is a set of key-value pairs, analogous to a Python dictionary. Examples can be found in the examples/ directory. The following sections describe the structure of the JSON objects used to interface with MachUp. Only one JSON object is specified per .json file. When using the JSON objects, only the scene object is passed to MachUp. As long as the paths to all other JSON objects are properly specified in the scene object, MachUp will automatically load all other required objects.

## Units
MachUp allows the user to specify the units for each value if they desire. For float values, this is done by making the value a list where the first element is the actual value and the second element is a string specifying the units. For example:

    "area" : [6.75, "ft^2"]

For vector inputs, such as position and velocity, the units are simply appended to the vector:

    "velocity" : [100.0, 13.0, 0.0, "ft/s"]

For array inputs, such as a density profile or chord distribution, the units are appended as another row in the array:

    "rho" : [[0.0, 1.225],
             [2000.0, 1.0066],
             [4000.0, 0.81935],
             ["m", "kg/m^3"]]

When specifying column units in files, these are also appended as another row:

    # File: density_profile.csv
    0.0, 1.225,
    2000.0, 1.0066,
    4000.0, 0.81935,
    "m", "kg/m^3"

The following measurements can be defined with the accompanying units:

| Measurement                   | Acceptable Units                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Position/displacement/length: | "ft", "m", "in", "cm"             |
| Area:                         | "ft^2", "m^2"                     |
| Velocity:                     | "ft/s", "m/s", "mph", "kph", "kn" |
| Angular deflection/position:  | "deg", "rad"                      |
| Angular rate:                 | "deg/s", "rad/s"                  |
| Density:                      | "slug/ft^3", "kg/m^3"             |
| Weight/Force:                 | "lbf", "N"                        |
| Moment:                       | "ft lbf", "Nm"                    |
*Note the carat is required in units containing powers. Otherwise, MachUpX will not recognize the unit specification.*

Except for angular measurements, the first unit listed is the default for "English" units. The second is the default for "SI". For angular measurements of state and control deflections, as well as airframe geometry, the default is always degrees. For airfoil parameters, measurements may only be expressed in radians. When specifying units in an array and one of the measurements is dimensionless (e.g. span fraction), "-" should be used. Any results generated by MachUpX will be output in the default unit for the given system, regardless of how units were specified for the inputs.

## Coordinate Systems
Throughout MachUpX, two coordinate systems are used. These are the body-fixed and earth-fixed coordinate systems. In the body-fixed coordinate system, the x-axis points forward out of the nose of the aircraft, the y-axis points to the right along the wing, and the z-axis points down. The body-fixed coordinate system has its origin at the aircraft's center of gravity.

In the earth-fixed coordinate system, the x-axis points North, the y-axis points East, and the z-axis points down. The origin of the earth-fixed coordinate system is somewhat arbitrary, but it is assumed to be at sea level. In this coordinate system, the earth is assumed to be flat.

These arrays can alternatively be stored as a csv file, in which case, this value should be the path to the file. NOTE: Since MachUpX uses earth-fixed coordinates for position, altitude values should be negative (i.e. 1000 ft above sea level would be -1000 ft).

A 6 column array is a field where the first three columns are positions in earth-fixed coordinates and the fourth through sixth columns are velocity components in earth-fixed coordinates. These arrays can alternatively be stored as a csv file, in which case, this value should be the path to the file.

If this is a 4-element vector it is assumed the quaternion formulation is used where the first element is the scalar (i.e. [e0, ex, ey, ez]).

MachUp pulls from these airfoil definitions as needed, depending on which airfoils are specified for the wings. If no airfoils are listed here MachUp will automatically generate a default airfoil and use it on all lifting surfaces. The default values listed above are for a flat plate as predicted by thin airfoil theory. Do not expect these to give you accurate results. A dictionary defining an airfoil has the following structure:

If this is a list, it must be an ordered list of span locations of length 2N+1 explicitly giving the span fraction location of each vortex node and control point. Should be arranged as ```[node_0_loc, cp_0_loc, node_1_loc, cp_1_loc,..., node_N_loc, cp_N_loc, node_N+1_loc]```. Defaults to "cosine_cluster".
>>>>
>>>>**"flap_edge_cluster" : bool, optional**
>>>>>If true, control points will be clustered around the edges of control surfaces. Can only be used if "distribution" is "cosine_cluster". Defaults to true.
>>>>
>>>>**"cluster_points" : list, optional**
>>>>>If extra clustering is desired (for example at a sharp change in geometry) the user can specify a list of additional span fractions here about which control points should be clustered. Can only be used is "distribution" is "cosine_cluster". Defaults to no extra clustering.
>>>
>>>**"control_surface" : dict, optional**
>>>>Defines a control surface on the trailing edge of the wing segment. Uses Phillips' approximations for trailing-edge flaps (Mechanics of Flight, ed. 2, Ch. 1.7).
>>>
>>>>**"root_span" : float, optional**
>>>>>The span location, as a fraction of total span, where the control surface begins. Defaults to 0.0.
>>>
>>>>**"tip_span" : float, optional**
>>>>>The span location, as a fraction of total span, where the control surface ends. Defaults to 1.0.
>>>
>>>>**"chord_fraction" : float, array, or string, optional**
>>>>>The depth of the control surface, as a fraction of the local chord length. Defined the same as "twist". If an array or file is specified, however, the start and end of the data must coincide with "root_span" and "tip_span", respectively. Defaults to 0.25.
>>>
>>>>**"is_sealed" : bool, optional**
>>>>>Whether or not the flap is sealed. Affects how parasitic drag is modelled. Defaults to true.
>>>
>>>>**"control_mixing" : dict**
>>>>>Determines which control inputs move this control surface. A control surface can be affected by any number of controls.
>>>>>
>>>>>**"<CONTROL_NAME>" : float**
>>>>>>Linearly maps the control deflection to the control surface deflection. The control deflection will be multiplied by this value and then applied to the control surface.
