Using the Scene Class
=====================

The Scene class is part of the machupX module, which is imported through the Python interpreter. The Scene class takes a file or a Python dictionary containing the configuration information described in 'Creating Input Files for MachUpX'. Various member functions of Scene can then be called to perform analyses on the aircraft in the scene.
