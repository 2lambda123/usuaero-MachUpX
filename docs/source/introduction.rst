Introduction
============

MachUpX is an implementation of Phillips' numerical lifting-line algorithm with some small modifications to increase its accuracy and versatility.

Emaples for using the MachUpX API can be found in the examples/ directory of the source code.

All functionality of MachUpX is accessed through the Scene class. Accessing lower-level classes directly may cause unexpected behavior.
