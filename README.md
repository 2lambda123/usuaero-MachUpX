# MachUpX
A new implementation of Warren F. Phillips' numerical lifting-line algorithm, combining the best of MachUp Pro and MachUp_Py.

Written by Cory Goates (graduate student, USU)

NOTE: THIS CODE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. ANY LEVEL OF FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT GUARANTEED AT THIS POINT.

Discussion of the numerical lifting-line algorithm can be found in the following sources:

Classic Lifting-Line Theory", Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 37, No. 4
(2000), pp. 662-670.

Flight, 2nd ed., Wiley, New Jersey, 2010, pp. 94 -107.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

### Getting the Source Code

You can either download the source as a ZIP file and extract the contents, or 
clone the MachUp repository using Git. If your system does not already have a 
version of Git installed, you will not be able to use this second option unless 
you first download and install Git. If you are unsure, you can check by typing 
`git --version` into a command prompt.

#### Downloading source as a ZIP file

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://github.com/usuaero/MachUpX](https://github.com/usuaero/MachUpX)
2. Make sure the Branch is set to `Master`
3. Click the `Clone or download` button
4. Select `Download ZIP`
5. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a local directory on your machine

#### Cloning the Github repository

1. From the command prompt navigate to the directory where MachUp will be installed
2. `git clone https://github.com/usuaero/MachUpX`
